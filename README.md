# 🌍 Climate Policy Simulator

An interactive full-stack web application that helps users **simulate, compare, and understand the impact of climate policies before implementation**.

Instead of guessing outcomes, users can test **“what-if” scenarios** like EV adoption, renewable energy usage, or tree plantation and instantly see projected emissions and long-term environmental impact.

Built during a hackathon using **React + Tailwind CSS (frontend)** and **Flask + Python (backend)** with AI-powered explanations.

## 🚨 Problem

Climate policies are often:
- implemented without clear impact prediction
- hard to compare with alternatives
- difficult for non-experts to understand

This leads to inefficient planning and delayed environmental action.

## 💡 Solution

Climate Policy Simulator provides:

✅ Interactive policy controls  
✅ Real-time climate simulations  
✅ Timeline projections  
✅ Scenario comparison  
✅ AI-powered explanations  

So decisions can be **data-driven, transparent, and smarter**.
